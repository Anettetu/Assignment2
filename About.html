<h1>About this page</h1> 
    <p class="center">
        Before I could get started with the project I had to prepare by reading about goal 3 and collect information about the covid vaccine. I also had to prepare the structure and design of the page. Here you can read more about the choices I made during the prosess.

        <h2>Structure</h2>

        <article>
                <h3>Files</h3>
                <p>
                    I began by creating separate folders for the images and the fonts I was going to use during the project. My files are named logically like naming the photo of a kid getting his vaccing, covid_vaccine, which made it easy to find the right files when making the page. 
                </p>

                <h3>Page structure</h3>
                <p>
                    I created a navigation menu at the top of the page so that the user easily could navigate between the pages. I decided to make it sticky so that the user always have access to it, even if they scroll to the bottom of the page. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the bottom of the page I added a footer with the information for NTNU. In the small screens, until 800px, the logo is placed on the top. When the screen is bigger than 800px

            <h2>Target group</h2>
                <p> 
                    This page is mainly created for kids in school between 6 and 12 years old. I have made my game with the intention to engange school classes in spreading awareness around children health.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The language is easy to understand so that the kids can play around on the site themselves.

            <h2> Design </h2>

                <h3> Visual hierarchy </h3>
                    <p>
                        The header-tags have different sizes to emphasize the main header and then the different subthemes. This creates a visual hierarchy which makes the content easier to read. 
                    </p>

                <h3>Typeface</h3>
                    <p>
                        The typeface I used on the webpage is Montserrat. I decided to stick with one typeface through my page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Montserrat is a sans-serif google font. I chose to go for that one because it's easy to read on all screens. Readability is especially important since the page is made for children.  
                    </p>

                <h3>Visuals</h3>
                    <p>
                        I decided to use the same main colors, green and blue, on all my pages. Since the page is ment to educate kids I used soft colors to make it playful, yet "professional". 
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        Green is often assiosiated with environment and is the color i chose with the content related to goal 3. Blue is often assosiated with health, patience and wisdom which is what I wanted kids to think of when reading about the covid virus. 
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        The text contrasts from the backgroundcolor which makes it easy to read for everyone, even if they are visually impaired. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The page width is the same on all elements to add a preception of having a border around the page. This makes the design consistent and structured. 
                    </p>

                <h2> Reflections </h2>
                    <p>
                        When working on the project I ended up devitating somewhat from my original idea. I learned new ways of doing things to acheive the design I wanted. I used my knowledge about graphical design to make design choices for the page, allthough I also tried to keep in mind that I was designing for children. I ended up with a page I find both playful, yet informative.
