            <h2>Dear children</h2>
            <p>
                Are you feeling scared or anxious about the coronavirus? We can understand that. Many children are unsure how the coronavirus will impact their lives, and whether it's dangerous. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Maybe you are afraid of being infected yourself? Or maybe you are scared that someone you know will be infected?
            </p>

            <p>
                For most children, the coronavirus is harmless. They rarely get symptoms, and if they do, they are experienced as a common cold. 
            </p>

            <h2>Then why is it important for you?</h2>
            <p>
                Eventhough you don't get really sick yourself, you can still infect others. The virus can be dangerous for the elderly, such as your grandparents, or people with underlying diseases. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Remember: It's never anyone's fault if you get infected.
